# Mission_to_Mars

# Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to improve the web app by adding aesthetically pleasing looks to an already well-functioning application.
This is done by retrieving the URLs of the images of Mars, adjusting the web app to include images themselves, and customization of the web
app to make it look as presentable as possible when using Bootstrap.
